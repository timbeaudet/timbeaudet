### 👋 Hello Turtles, I am Tim Beaudet

![Tim Hikes](https://www.timbeaudet.com/goods/tim_hikes_16x9_small.jpg)

I am building a business making racing games and sharing the process; good and _bad_ with the world. I worked on games like Rock Band 3, Darkest of Days and Monster High (Wii). I also participate in many game jams and may be up for collaborating and helping.
